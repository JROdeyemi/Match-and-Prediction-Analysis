# Match-and-Prediction-Analysis
This is one of the most exciting projects I've worked on so far. 
I particularly enjoyed doing this because I love football, and I am a fan of Manchester United (Best club in the world). 
In this project, I did an analysis of the performance of teams in each of the leagues using the same metrics.
I looked at;
  1. Total number of league matches played within that period.
This is self-explanatory. For every analysis, we need to first of all know the total number of record/entries we are dealing with.
Also, some of the leagues have 20 teams vying for the title, while some have 18. Therefore, the total number of matches played can not be the same for all the leagues.

  2. Average number of goals scored per match
It has been established that there will be varying number of matches played, therefore, it is easy to assume to that the leagues with the most matches will score more goals.
However, that will be a wrong way of judging performance. The average was calculated so the leagues can be judged based on the number of matches they played. 
A league that scored goals while playing 3 games is surely doing better than a league that scores 12 goals while playing 6 games.

  3. Highest occuring scorelines
This was looked into from the prediction perspective. This is to help bookies/punters know what scoreline to predict or bet on. It is to also help guess which of the competing teams would win.

  4. Average number of goals scored per team
Just like finding the average number of goals per match, I did this analysis to ascertain which team has the best match-to-goal ratio. 
Some clubs played more matches, but they have a poorer match-to-goal ratio when compared with teams that played lesser number of games. 

Go on and take a look at this analysis and see for yourself which league scores most goals, which teams score most goals, which side to bet on.
